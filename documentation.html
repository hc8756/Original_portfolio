    <h1>Process documentation</h1>

        Like many others in this class, I am planning on using my portfolio to introduce myself to potential employers or collaborators. Therefore, I wanted a portfolio that could a) effectively
        display all my best work, b) show my personality.
        As for my work- as a game design student, I find that most of my projects are either video games or digitial (and a few analog) artworks. Therefore my work is divided largely
        into "games" and "art". At the bottom of the page is information about me and how to contact me. 
        As for the look of the website, I wanted to show that I am creative, fun-loving, and not too serious. I drew a lot of inspiration from mikimottes.com- I loved how the portfolio felt
        "alive"- I remember that in one of my notes I wrote that I wanted my portfolio to feel like a playground: very visually entertaining and interactive.
        Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I couldn't really implement a lot of this, but I am happy with my "go up" button, which I successfully animated through css.
        The overall portfolio is racoon-themed because it has always been and probably always will be my spirit animal.

        I used a google font called "Coming Soon", and all the images I used were created myself. 
        For image dimensions, I have made sure that the originals weren't too big (about twice as big as they would be shown on my website).
        I have structured my html so that new projects are relatively easy to add, all I need to do is copy and paste a section with class "projectSection"- and my css will format the images and text. 
        For the future, I want to add design elements to the website that make it look more hand drawn and animated because that's the aesthetic I am going for (for example, I want project images to animate when I hover over them). I will also have to get the message box fully functional as right now it is more of a placeholder that doesn't send information anywhere.

        Below is my initial sketch of my website that I referenced during this project.
